# Hey there, I'm Zal!
A 16-year-old student from Indonesia with a strong interest in AI and Machine Learning. 💡<br><br>
I'm currently learning Python through hands-on projects, playing with data, automation, and problem-solving. Most of my projects start from freeCodeCamp and are reworked using my own logic.

# 📊 GitHub Stats:
I'm a big believer in "learning by doing", so you'll mostly see me experimenting with code, breaking things, and trying to build something cool along the way.
I enjoy learning as if it were a game, and I treat GitHub as my "Duolingo for programmers" where I try to make at least one contribution per day to keep my streak alive. <br>
